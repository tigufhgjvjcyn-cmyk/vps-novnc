## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk.**
This application requires your Discord **User Token** to function. Using a user token for automated actions or "self-botting" can technically violate Discord's Terms of Service. However, this app only sends Rich Presence updates (Identity & Presence), which is generally considered safe for personal use.
*   **Never share your token with anyone.**
*   The developer is not responsible for any account bans or restrictions.
